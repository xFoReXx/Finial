			<p>The decorated stone finial from Church Island is a skeuomorph. It is a copy of the finial feature of a
				timber roof, where the two end-rafters were overlapped and joined together. The bottom section, or
				tenon, functioned as a means to hold the finial in place atop the stone roof. Such a finial served no
				practical function on a stone roof, so it seems that the builders of this church wished to create an
				architectural link with the form of the earlier wooden church.

			<p>Church Island, a small, exposed island in Valentia Harbour, Co. Kerry, is home to an important early
				medieval monastic settlement. During excavations, undertaken by Michael J. O’Kelly in the 1950s, it was
				found that the island featured a small wooden church. This was replaced by a stone church, which still
				stands today. The excavations also found evidence of a roundhouse, a clochán or bee-hive hut, and
				another rectangular house, and a cemetery. It is difficult to ascertain whether this site was a
				monastery or a community church which would have served the local area, though the burial of a woman on
				the island might suggest the latter. Early wooden churches, such as the example on Church Island, were
				built of oak and had thatched roofs. In the annals the Irish word dairthech is commonly used to describe
				these building: dair means oak, while thech is an early version of teach, meaning house. When these
				buildings were replaced in stone some of their wooden features, though unnecessary in stone buildings,
				were copied as skeuomorphs.</p>

			<p>Carved stone monuments are among our most tangible links to the distant past. From the La Tène-decorated
				examples of the Late Iron Age (AD 1–400), to the cross-slabs and high crosses of the early medieval
				period (AD 400–1200), people in late prehistoric and early historic Ireland used stone carving to
				express their values and identities as skilled craftspeople and as members of kin-groups and wider
				communities. Stone was carved to preserve the memory of revered ancestors and deceased loved ones, to
				assert ownership of tracts of land, and to serve as focal points for communal rituals and devotions.
				These monuments have huge potential to enhance our understanding and enjoyment of Ireland’s past and its
				links to the wider world, for some designs indicate connections across Europe and as far afield as the
				Middle East. Medieval masons used a variety of different tools to cut their stones. Axes, points, and
				chisels would be used for the rough and fine carving, with drills occasionally being employed for
				undercutting (especially in sculpture). Designs would be imposed on the surface of the block using a
				series of incised lines.</p>

			<p>Was it the exposed nature of the island which led to the building of more
				staunch and durable structures than the earlier ones had been ? There is some
				reason to think, though again there is no absolute proof, that the oratory was the
				first of the buildings to be planned on a more impressive scale. It has been
				mentioned above that Church Island consists entirely of a spur of greenstone
				diorite which rises out of the sea. No part of the island is formed of any kind of
				sedimentary rock. It is, therefore, rather surprising to find that the stone
				oratory is built entirely of purple slate, every bit of which must have been
				imported from Valencia Island the nearest point of which is 1-5 km., (1 mile
				approximately) to the south-west, or from the southern side of Doulus Head,
				about the same distance to the north. To quarry such a quantity of large slabs
				of stone and to bring them either by boat or raft to Church Island and land them
				there, seems to argue for good organization and help from the neighbourhood.</p>

			</div>
			<p>Two finials have survived and though neither of them was found in or near
				the ruins of the oratory it is presumed that both originally adorned its roof ridge.
				The decorated finial was found on the sandy bed of the sea to
				the east of the island on an occasion several years ago when there was ann except
				tionally low tide. How it came to be in the water will never be known, but it may
				have been taken from the island for use as a boat anchor because of the ease with
				which a rope could be tied to it. It if was in the sea for a long time it must have
				been embedded in the sand for though it is heavily weathered and has suffered
				other damage, it shows no signs of the rolling and smoothingh one associates
				with water action.</p>
