To enable users to rotate 3D models on a website, you'll need a tool to render these models in the browser. One popular tool for this purpose is the Three.js library, which allows rendering 3D graphics using WebGL in the browser.

If you'd like to share a 3D model with me to put it on a website, unfortunately, I cannot accept files or process them in real-time. However, I can provide you with instructions on how to do it yourself.

Here's a general guide on how to do it using Three.js:

Prepare the model in Blender:

Import your 3D scan into Blender.
Ensure your model is properly prepared, correctly meshed, and ready for rendering.
Export the model from Blender:

Use Blender's export feature to save your model in a format supported by Three.js. The most commonly used format is .glTF (GL Transmission Format).
Adding the model to the webpage using Three.js:

Include the Three.js library on your webpage. You can either download it directly or use hosted versions.
Add JavaScript code that loads your 3D model and allows interaction with it, such as rotation.

Preparing a Blender Model for Sketchfab: Ensure your model is ready for sharing, with all textures, materials, and animations if needed.

Creating a Sketchfab Account: If you haven't already, create an account on the Sketchfab website.

Exporting the Model from Blender: In Blender, use the export option to export your model to a format supported by Sketchfab, such as .obj or .fbx. To do this, select the model, then go to the "File" menu -> "Export" and choose the appropriate export format.

Uploading the Model to Sketchfab: After exporting, go to your Sketchfab account and log in. Then use the "Upload" or "Add a model" option to add your 3D model. Follow the on-screen instructions to upload your model.

Configuring Settings: After uploading, you can configure various settings such as thumbnail, description, tags, visibility, interactivity, etc.

Publishing the Model: Once you've configured all the settings, you can publish your model, making it available to other users.

After completing these steps, your Blender 3D model will be available on the Sketchfab platform, and you'll receive a link that you can share or embed on a website.
